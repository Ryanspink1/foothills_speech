              "My son was diagnosed with ASD nearly 3 years ago when he was 22 months old.  Since the beginning we have been coming to see Jeff Steffen.  His work with my son has been so thorough without sacrificing patience; and his ability to connect with him is tremendous, even on his first day.  When it seemed next to impossible to communicate with my son, Jeff has captured ways to make it happen."

              "After a surgery, i was told by my throat specialist that there was little hope I would regain my voice. It was very disheartening news. The doctor sent me here where i started working with Allison. She gave me excercises and "homework" and was confident from the start that I could be fixed. Last week, there was a huge breakthrough and my voice is 80% back. We still have work to do, but this is the best news I've had in a while and I am confident that I will be better than ever.
              Thank you Allison!"

              "Jeff was recommended to us by our Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) physician when our 13-month old son was not speaking.  Jeff was able to make our therapy sessions fun for our son and he gave us guidance on how to better encourage speech for our young son.  Our son made huge improvements immediately after working with Jeff and he continues to improve daily.  Our son is now 2 and he is at average or above average levels.  Jeff has the unique ability to be able to communicate effectively with children and adults.  Jeff's love for his work radiates from him.  we are so grateful for everything that he has done for us."
